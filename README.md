> Vader: If only you knew the power of the Dark Side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. <br />
Luke: He told me enough! He told me you killed him! <br />
Vader: No. I am your father. <br />
Luke: [shocked] No. No! That's not true! That's impossible! <br />
Vader: Search your feelings; you know it to be true! <br />
Luke: NOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO!!!
